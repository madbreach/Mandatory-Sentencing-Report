# Mandatory Sentencing

Paper written at Westminster College for Courts & Law analyzing a professional opinon on matters regarding mandatory sentencing in cyber space. 

Writing an opinion on the current cyber sentencing laws was difficult because cyber cases are so vastly different. It is hard to formulate a signle way to sentence these types of crimes. This paper required a lot of critical thinking and ethical/social responibility in order to make a statement on what I felt was fair, and in what ways I feel would be appropriate to reform the law.
